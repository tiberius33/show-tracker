/**
 * admin-resync-setlists — walks every user's shows, finds the ones whose
 * artist resolves to a band source, and re-fetches their setlists from that
 * source.
 *
 * Shaped after admin-populate-setlist.js: admin-only, Authorization: Bearer
 * {idToken} verified against ADMIN_EMAILS, CORS headers, firebase-admin
 * server-side.
 *
 * POST body:
 *   {
 *     dryRun?: boolean,   // DEFAULT TRUE. See below.
 *     limit?: number,     // max shows to consider (default 25, max 1000)
 *     userId?: string,    // restrict to one account
 *     source?: string,    // restrict to one band source id
 *     delayMs?: number,   // override the inter-request delay
 *     cursor?: string,    // resume token from a previous run's nextCursor
 *     budgetMs?: number,  // override the time budget (see the constants)
 *   }
 *
 * ── dryRun defaults to TRUE, on purpose ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is a data migration over show documents people care about. The
 * default has to be the harmless one, so that forgetting a parameter
 * reports a plan instead of rewriting a few thousand setlists. Writing
 * requires `dryRun: false` explicitly.
 *
 * A dry run writes NOTHING and returns, per show: user, show id, date,
 * venue, current source, current song count, incoming song count, and the
 * diff summary from lib/bandSetlistMerge — songs added, songs removed,
 * songs whose set or position changed, fields newly populated, and what
 * user-authored data was carried over. That summary is produced by the same
 * merge rule a real run would use, so the plan is not an approximation of
 * what would happen; it is what would happen.
 *
 * ── Rate limiting ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * elgoose.net and phish.net are small community projects and this walks
 * every show in the database. Two things keep that civil:
 *
 *   1. The cache in band-setlist.js means each distinct (source, date) is
 *      fetched upstream once, however many users attended that night. On a
 *      jam-band tracker that is a big multiplier — a Goose run at the Cap
 *      might be logged by dozens of users and costs one request.
 *   2. DEFAULT_DELAY_MS between requests, skipped entirely on a cache hit
 *      since that never touches the upstream host. See the note on the
 *      constants below for why this is 300ms and not the 1200ms the first
 *      version used.
 *
 * A Netlify function is killed at 10 seconds, so a full backfill runs as
 * several invocations rather than one. Each returns `truncated: true` and a
 * `nextCursor`; pass that back as `cursor` to resume exactly where it
 * stopped. The walk stops on its own time budget before Netlify kills it,
 * so a truncated run still returns its report.

// ── Fitting inside a Netlify function's execution window ─────────────
//
// A Netlify synchronous function is killed at 10 seconds by default, and
// nothing in netlify.toml raises it. That constraint dictates these
// numbers, and the first version of this file got them badly wrong: a
// 1200ms delay with a default limit of 50 meant 60 seconds of sleeping
// alone, so the function was guaranteed to be killed at 10s having
// processed about eight shows — and because the report is only returned at
// the very end, the caller got a 502 and NOTHING. Every invocation was
// wasted work, and a real run (dryRun:false) would have written a partial
// set of changes and then died without reporting which ones.
//
// So: 300ms, which is what every other admin function in this repo uses
// against setlist.fm, and a hard time budget that stops the walk cleanly
// and returns the partial report with a resumable cursor. The politeness
// argument for 1200ms was weaker than it looked — the real protection
// against hammering elgoose.net is the cache in band-setlist.js, which
// fetches each distinct date once however many users attended that night,
// and the delay only applies on a cache miss.
//
// A full backfill is therefore several invocations, each resuming from the
// previous one's `nextCursor`. If that becomes tedious, the proper fix is
// to rename this to admin-resync-setlists-background.js: Netlify gives a
// background function 15 minutes instead of 10 seconds. That changes how
// it is invoked (202 immediately, results only in the logs), which is why
// it is not done here — a dry run you can read the output of is the whole
