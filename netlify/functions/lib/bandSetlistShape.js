/**
 * netlify/functions/lib/bandSetlistShape.js
 *
 * The normalized song shape every band-source adapter produces, and the
 * canonical-label / transition logic they all share. The adapters
 * (elgooseAdapter.js, phishnetAdapter.js) are then nothing but "fetch this
 * URL and tell me which upstream key means what" — which is the only part
 * that differs between sources, and the only part that needs re-checking
 * against a live response.
 *
 * ── The contract with the rest of the app ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * A song object here must be readable by everything that already consumes
 * a stored setlist: lib/songIndex.js, lib/setlistGrouping.js,
 * lib/bustOuts.js, lib/playlistCreator.js, components/shows/SetlistView.jsx,
 * components/shows/ShowDetailView.jsx and components/runs/RunDetailView.jsx.
 * So every field those already read keeps its exact current meaning:
 *
 *   id      – the same "timestamp base36 + random" id extractSongsFromSetlist
 *             mints. groupSongsBySet and songIndex key off it.
 *   name    – song title, trimmed.
 *   set     – one of the canonical labels ('Set I', 'Set II', 'Encore',
 *             'Encore II', …) that groupSongsBySet's CANONICAL_ORDER sorts.
 *   cover   – the covered artist's name, or null.
 *   tape    – "this song ran into the next one". See the long note below.
 *
 * Everything past that is new, optional, and absent on setlist.fm-sourced
 * shows — so a consumer that doesn't know about it is unaffected.
 *
 * ── On `tape`, which does not mean what setlist.fm means by it ────────
 *
 * setlist.fm's `tape` flag means "this was a recording played over the PA,
 * not performed". This codebase has never used it that way. Since the
 * transitions work it has meant "this song segues into the next one":
 * lib/songIndex.js derives `segueOut: !!song.tape` and a song's `segueIn`
 * from the previous song's flag, SetlistView.jsx renders a "> segue" line
 * off `t.tape`, and lib/__tests__/songIndex.test.js asserts exactly that
 * ("a song's segue-out is its own `tape` flag and its segue-in is the
 * previous song's").
 *
 * So `tape` keeps that meaning here — a band source sets it for a real
 * segue and leaves it false for a plain comma. What a band source *adds*
 * is `transitionMark`, the literal mark the archive recorded, so the UI can
 * render the actual '>' or '->' instead of a generic indicator while `tape`
 * goes on carrying the boolean every existing consumer reads.
 *
 * Renaming `tape` to `segue` is the right end state. It is not this change:
 * it touches seven files and every stored show document, and it deserves
 * its own PR rather than riding along inside a data-source migration.

 * inflate a show's song count, add phantom plays to the personal song index
 * and its gap counts, feed lib/bustOuts.js performances that never happened
 * in front of an audience, and land in generated playlists. 'Soundcheck' is
 * also not in groupSongsBySet's CANONICAL_ORDER, so it would render as an
 * ordinary trailing section with no indication it wasn't part of the set.
 *
 * Dropping them is the choice that leaves every existing field meaning
 * exactly what it means today. The count is reported on the response as
 * `droppedSoundcheckCount` so the rows are visibly discarded rather than
 * silently lost, and adding them back later is a deliberate act: give
 * SOUNDCHECK_LABEL a place in CANONICAL_ORDER after the encores and teach
