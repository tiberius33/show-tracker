/**
 * admin-merge-festivals — Admin-only tool to find duplicate canonical
 * festivals in the shared catalog and merge them into one.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Dedup at create time (context/AppContext.jsx's
 * findFestivalMatchesFor, surfaced inline by the create form) is advisory
 * by design: it shows matches and never blocks creation, because a wrong
 * auto-join is worse than a duplicate. So duplicates accumulate — two
 * people typing "Outside Lands" and "Outside Lands Music & Arts Festival"
 * a day apart, or someone creating one before the catalog had loaded.
 * Nothing could clean those up: the client cannot delete a canonical
 * (`allow delete: if false` in firestore.rules) and there was no admin
 * path either, so an un-merge needed a one-off function every time.
 *
 * POST body:
 *   { action: "scan", limit? }
 *     Read-only. Clusters the whole canonical catalog by the shared match
 *     rule and returns every cluster with 2+ members, each member carrying
 *     its attendee count, plus a suggested survivor and any users who are
 *     already on more than one member. Writes nothing, ever.
 *
 *   { action: "merge", survivorId, duplicateIds[], confirmUnmatched?,
 *     allowSharedAttendees?, dryRun? }
 *     Repoints every attendance record on each duplicate at survivorId,
 *     then deletes the duplicate canonical documents. dryRun defaults to
 *     TRUE; nothing is written unless it is explicitly false.
 *
 * Auth header: Authorization: Bearer {idToken}   (admin account only)
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES
 *   - Never touches a show. Shows link to a festival by the ATTENDANCE
 *     record's id, and this only ever rewrites that record's `festivalId`
 *     pointer, never its id — so every attached show stays attached and no
 *     show document is read or written here at all.
 *   - Never deletes or edits an attendance record, a note or a rating.
 *   - Never edits the survivor. Its name, dates and location are whatever
 *     its creator set; disagreements with the duplicates are reported, not
 *     merged in. Fixing the survivor's own fields is a separate, ordinary
 *     edit.
 *   - Never deletes a canonical while anything still points at it. The
 *     repoint happens first and the delete only runs after it succeeds, so
 *     an interrupted merge leaves records pointing at a festival that still
 *     exists rather than a dangling id.
 *   - Never merges two different editions. See THE YEAR GUARD below.
 *
 * THE EDITION GUARD. The one thing this tool must never do is collapse
 * Bonnaroo 2025 into Bonnaroo 2026 — the exact failure the shared match
 * rule's date gate exists to prevent, now reachable by hand. So:
 *
 *   - Pairs the rule matches: allowed.
 *   - Pairs the rule does not match, starting more than
 *     MAX_MANUAL_MERGE_GAP_DAYS apart, or with a start date too malformed
 *     to measure: REFUSED, with no override. There is no flag for this.
 *   - Pairs the rule does not match but which start close together (dates
 *     typed a fortnight apart, or names too dissimilar to score): allowed
 *     only with confirmUnmatched: true, so it is a deliberate act.
 *
 * The gap is measured in days rather than by comparing calendar years,
 * which would be the obvious way and is wrong: a festival running 30 Dec to
 * 2 Jan starts in a different year from a duplicate someone recorded as
 * starting 1 Jan, and a year comparison would call those two editions and
 * refuse a merge that is plainly correct. Two days apart is two days apart
 * whichever side of New Year it falls; a real edition boundary is ~365.
 *
 * SHARED ATTENDEES. If someone has their own attendance record on the
 * survivor AND on a duplicate, repointing both leaves them with two
 * records on one festival — two identical cards on their Festivals page.
 * Merging those records is not safe to do automatically: each one carries
 * its own notes, its own rating and its own attached shows, and shows hang
 * off the record id, so discarding either loses data. The merge therefore
 * REFUSES by default and names the users affected. allowSharedAttendees:
 * true proceeds anyway, accepting the duplicate cards as the lesser evil
 * (they can then be resolved by hand, per user, without losing anything).
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. A second identical merge finds the duplicates already gone
 * and reports zero repointed, zero deleted.
