/**
 * band-setlist — one date-addressed setlist fetch, whichever band source
 * owns the artist.
 *
 *   GET /api/band-setlist?source=elgoose&artist=Goose&date=2025-07-18
 *   GET /api/band-setlist?source=phishnet&artist=Phish&date=1997-11-22&venue=Hampton%20Coliseum
 *   GET /api/band-setlist?source=elgoose&artist=Goose&date=2026-08-15&debug=1
 *
 * `debug=1` adds an `upstream` object reporting the envelope's top-level
 * keys, the type of `data`, the row count and the first row's key names.
 * That is how you check this adapter's FIELDS map against what the
 * archive actually sends — particularly the case where songs come back
 * fine but one field is missing from every one of them.
 *
 * It bypasses the cache in both directions, so it always reflects what
 * the archive is sending right now and never leaves a debug-shaped
 * response in the cache for other callers.
 *
 * `source` is a band-source id from lib/setlistSources.js ('elgoose' or
 * 'phishnet'). The per-source fetch and field mapping live in
 * netlify/functions/lib/{elgoose,phishnet}Adapter.js, one file per source,
 * so adding Grateful Dead later is a new adapter plus a new branch in
 * ADAPTERS below and nothing else.
 *
 * ── Why this is so much smaller than the setlist.fm path ─────────────
 *
 * Both APIs are addressable by show date. That is the real win. Finding one
 * night on setlist.fm means scanForMissingSetlists's loop: up to three
 * pages × three artist-name variants, each page 20 results, reversing
 * setlist.fm's DD-MM-YYYY into YYYY-MM-DD to compare, hoping the night is
 * in there somewhere. Here it is one request for one date, and either the
 * archive has the show or it doesn't.
 *
 * ── Caching ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Mirrors search-setlists.js: Firestore-backed, age-derived TTL, X-Cache:
 * HIT|MISS|STALE, stale-on-upstream-failure fallback, hit counting, and the
 * same getDb() lazy-init-with-graceful-degradation — if the Firebase env
 * vars are missing the function still works, just uncached.
 *
 * The one deliberate difference is the TTL ceiling. determineTtlHours in
 * search-setlists.js gives a show more than two years old a 7-day TTL,
 * which is right for setlist.fm and wrong here: phish.net's docs are
 * explicit that you should cache locally but for no longer than 24 hours,
 * because setlists get corrected after review. A corrected Phish setlist
 * should reach the app the next day, not the next week — so the ceiling is
 * 24h for both sources, since elgoose.net is a reviewed archive too and
 * there is no reason to treat it differently.
 *
 * A separate collection (`bandSetlistCache`) keyed by source + artist +
 * date, so it cannot collide with `setlistCache`.
 *
 * ── The API key ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PHISHNET_API_KEY, read server-side only, with NO `||` literal fallback.
 * search-setlists.js and admin-populate-setlist.js both do
 * `process.env.SETLISTFM_API_KEY || '<a real key>'`, which puts a live key
 * in the repository and in the function bundle. That pattern is not
 * repeated here: a missing key returns a 503 saying so. elgoose.net needs
 * no key at all.

// --- Cache helpers ---

// ── Why the cache key carries a version ───────────────────────────────
//
// A cached response is a snapshot of what the ADAPTER produced, not of what
// the archive sent, so every correction to a field mapping changes the
// meaning of every entry already stored. Without a version in the key those
// stale entries keep being served for up to MAX_TTL_HOURS after the fix
// ships — which looks exactly like "the fix works on some shows and not
// others", because whether a given date is stale depends on whether anyone
// happened to ask for it before the deploy.
//
// That is not hypothetical: this feature shipped four adapter corrections
// in one afternoon (5.33.4 and 5.33.5 between them fixed the permalink and
// four wrong field names), and any date fetched between them is cached
// wrong until tomorrow.
//
// BUMP THIS whenever the adapters' output changes shape or meaning. It
// costs one re-fetch per date and it is the difference between a fix being
// live and a fix being live eventually.
//
//   1 — 5.33.0, the original mapping
//   2 — 5.34.3: elgoose rows are filtered by artist, and everything the
//       5.33.4/5.33.5 corrections changed (permalink, jamchart_notes,
//       song_id, original_artist, shownotes)
