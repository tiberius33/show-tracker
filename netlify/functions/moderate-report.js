/**
 * moderate-report — the three actions an admin can take on a report from
 * the Moderation queue in AdminView: dismiss it, delete the content, or
 * delete the content and ban its author.
 *
 * Admin-only, same Bearer-token check as the other admin-* functions in
 * this directory. It is a function rather than a client write for the
 * same reason report-content.js is: every one of these actions touches a
 * document the caller does not own — someone else's comment, someone
 * else's profile — which only the Admin SDK can do.
 *
 * POST body: { reportId, action: "dismiss" | "delete" | "ban" }
 * Auth header: Authorization: Bearer {idToken}   (admin account only)
 *
 * WHAT EACH ACTION DOES
 *
 *   dismiss — the report was wrong. If three reports had already pulled
 *             the content out of circulation, it goes back, with its
 *             original document id, so every reply, like and link to it
 *             still resolves. The counter is cleared so the same three
 *             reports cannot re-hide it the moment it returns.
 *
 *   delete  — the content is gone for good: removed from its collection
 *             if it is still there, and from moderationHidden if it was
 *             auto-hidden. Storage bytes for a photo are left alone,
 *             matching deletePhoto() in lib/photos.js — an orphaned file
 *             wastes a little space, where a failed storage call that
 *             aborted the delete would leave the content up.
 *
 *   ban     — EJECTION. Apple's wording is "ejecting the user who
 *             provided the offending content", and what this action used
 *             to do did not meet it: `banned: true` on the profile stopped
 *             them writing, but they could still sign in, still read, and
 *             every word they had already posted stayed up. The confirm
 *             dialog said as much out loud.
 *
 *             It now does four things:
 *               1. `banned: true` on the profile, which firestore.rules
 *                  and moderate-content.js both refuse writes against.
 *               2. Disables the Firebase Auth account, so sign-in fails
 *                  with auth/user-disabled.
 *               3. Revokes refresh tokens, so sessions already open on
 *                  other devices stop working at their next refresh
 *                  rather than lasting until the token expires.
 *               4. Sweeps every comment, meetup message and photo they
 *                  ever posted into `moderationHidden`, which only an
 *                  admin can read — so it is gone for everyone else but
 *                  recoverable if the decision was wrong.
 *
 *             The sweep is deliberately a move, not a delete, and it uses
 *             the same quarantine collection auto-hide uses. Mass-
 *             deleting a user's history on one report is not reversible;
 *             moving it is.
 *
 * Every action closes every OPEN report against that content, not just
 * the one the admin clicked — three reports about one comment are one
 * decision, and leaving the other two open would show the same comment
 * in the queue three times.
