                <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to your account</li>

              <p className="mt-3">We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">3. User Content</h2>
              <p className="mb-3">The Service allows you to create setlists, mark shows as attended, add personal notes and ratings, and share content with other users ("User Content").</p>

              <p className="mb-3"><strong className="text-primary">Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of the User Content you create. By posting or sharing User Content through the Service, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, display, and distribute your User Content solely for the purpose of operating and providing the Service.</p>

              <p className="mb-3"><strong className="text-primary">Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for your User Content. You represent and warrant that:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-2">
                <li>You have the right to post your User Content</li>
                <li>Your User Content does not violate any third party's rights, including intellectual property or privacy rights</li>
                <li>Your User Content does not contain unlawful, defamatory, harassing, or otherwise objectionable material</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-3">We reserve the right to remove any User Content that violates these Terms, at our sole discretion.</p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">4. Community Guidelines</h2>
              <p className="mb-3"><strong className="text-primary">Zero tolerance.</strong> MySetlists is a place to talk about shows you went to. There is no version of that conversation which needs slurs, harassment, sexual content, threats of violence, or content that impersonates someone else or infringes their copyright. Post any of it and it will be removed.</p>

              <p className="mb-3"><strong className="text-primary">We filter before you post.</strong> Comments, captions, meetup messages, display names and handles are checked automatically before they are published. Content that fails the check is rejected outright rather than posted and removed later.</p>

              <p className="mb-3"><strong className="text-primary">You can report anything.</strong> Every comment, photo, video, meetup message and profile carries a report control (the flag icon). Reports are anonymous to the person you report. We commit to reviewing every report <strong className="text-primary">within 24 hours</strong> and removing anything that breaks these guidelines. Content reported by three or more people is hidden automatically while it waits for that review.</p>

              <p className="mb-3"><strong className="text-primary">You can block anyone.</strong> Blocking a user hides their comments, photos, meetup messages, tags and activity from you, and removes you from each other's friends list. You can block someone from the report dialog, from their card in your friends list, or from their profile, and you can undo it at any time under Profile → Blocked accounts.</p>

              <p className="mb-3"><strong className="text-primary">Repeat offenders lose their account.</strong> Accounts that post objectionable content are banned. A banned account can still read and can still export its own data, but cannot post comments, upload media, or create or join meetups.</p>

              <p>To report something you cannot reach through the app — including content you have seen without being signed in — email <a href="mailto:support@mysetlists.net" className="text-brand hover:text-brand underline">support@mysetlists.net</a>. We answer moderation reports sent there on the same 24-hour commitment.</p>
