// components/auth/SuspendedScreen.jsx
//
// What an ejected account sees.
//
// Guideline 1.2 asks the developer to eject users who post objectionable
// content, and moderate-report.js now does that properly: the Auth
// account is disabled, its refresh tokens are revoked, and everything it
// published is quarantined. But disabling an account does not log
// anybody out on the spot — the ID token in hand stays valid until it
// expires, and until then the app runs signed in against a profile whose
// every write is refused by the rules.
//
// Without this screen that hour looks like a broken app: comments fail to
// post with a permission error, the feed is empty because the content is
// gone, and nothing says why. This is the honest version, and it is also
// what stops a confused ejected user filing a support ticket about a bug.
//
// Deliberately plain: no navigation, no retry, and the only action is to
// sign out (which is also what makes the state resolve, since signing
// back in is refused by Firebase with auth/user-disabled).
