// Two things the back gesture and the back button both need, and neither
// of which the app tracked before:
//
//   1. THE DISMISS STACK. On release, the gesture has to answer "what is
//      the topmost dismissable thing right now?" LIFO, so a sheet opened
//      over a modal closes first. Every overlay registers with
//      useDismissable(); the gesture is only as good as its worst-covered
//      overlay.
//
//   2. IN-APP NAVIGATION DEPTH. "Can we go back?" must not come from
//      window.history.length — in a Capacitor SPA it is never zero and
//      counts entries that are not ours, so it reports "yes" on a cold
//      deep link where going back leaves the app. Instead we keep our own
//      stack of visited paths. Depth 0 means there is nothing of ours to
//      go back to.
//
// Root routes (lib/navRoutes.js ROOT_ROUTES) reset the stack, which is what
// makes them floors: you can never swipe back out of one.
