/**
 * Tests that need to BE signed in but do not exercise signing in.
 *
 * These reuse the single session captured by e2e/auth.setup.js and cost no
 * Firebase sign-in of their own. They live in their own file, apart from
 * auth.smoke.spec.js, because Playwright selects projects by FILE: the
 * `smoke-auth` project depends on the setup project and this file belongs
 * to it, while auth.smoke.spec.js's signed-out tests belong to `smoke`,
 * which has no such dependency.
 *
 * That split is deliberate and was learned the hard way. When the whole
 * smoke project depended on setup, a throttled test account failed setup
 * and took all 36 tests down with it — including the two dozen that never
 * touch authentication at all (API health, email endpoints, legal pages).
 * That is strictly worse signal than the problem it was fixing. Now a
 * sign-in outage costs exactly the tests that genuinely need a session.
 *
 * The signed-in storage state comes from the project config, not a
 * `test.use()` here, so there is one place that decides it.
