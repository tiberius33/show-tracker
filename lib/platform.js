// phone" — Tailwind's `md:` breakpoint — and no JS equivalent at all. The
// gesture layer needs a JS answer, and two sources of truth that can drift
// apart is how you end up with a header that thinks it's on mobile and a
// gesture that thinks it isn't. MOBILE_MEDIA_QUERY below is derived from
// the same 768px that `md:` uses, so CSS and JS cannot disagree.

// JS gesture competing with the browser's own back gesture produces a
// fight the user always loses. Native and installed-PWA have no browser
// chrome, so there the gesture is the only back affordance and is always on.
//
// This is deliberately one constant so the behaviour is one line to flip
// if device testing says otherwise.
