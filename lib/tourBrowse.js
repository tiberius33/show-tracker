// ── Already-in-your-account check ─────────────────────────────────────
// The single most important correctness property of bulk add: a night the
// user already has must be marked and unselectable, because the worst
// outcome of this feature is silently doubling their history.
//
// Rule, in order:
//   1. `setlistfmId` equality — exact, and the only check that can't be
//      fooled by a spelling difference. Everything imported from
//      setlist.fm (including via this flow) carries one.
//   2. artist + date + fuzzy venue — the fallback for shows added by hand
//      or imported from CSV, which have no setlistfmId. Artist is
//      compared case-insensitively, date exactly (both sides are already
//      normalized to yyyy-MM-dd), and venue through the app's existing
//      venuesFuzzyMatch, so "Dick's Sporting Goods Park" vs "Dicks
//      Sporting Goods Park" still counts as the same night.
//
// A third, weaker signal is reported separately rather than folded in:
// same artist + same date but a venue that doesn't fuzzy-match at all.
// That's *probably* the same night typed differently, but it's also
// legitimately two sets in one day, so it stays selectable and is
// surfaced as "you may already have this" — visible, never silent.
