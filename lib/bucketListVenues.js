/**
 * Firestore helpers for the "venue bucket list" — venues a user wants to
 * see *any* show at, distinct from lib/bucketList.js (a specific
 * artist+venue+date they want to attend). Keyed the same way lib/venues.js
 * keys a Venue doc (`${name}::${city}`) so it's directly joinable with the
 * venue detail page and the daily match job below.
 *
 * Schema: top-level `bucketListVenues` collection, one doc per entry, doc
 * id `${uid}_${venueKey}` — same "top-level collection + owner-uid field"
 * convention as lib/bucketList.js, reusing its already-deployed rule shape.
 *
 *   bucketListVenues/{uid}_{venueKey}
 *     {
 *       userId: string,
 *       venueKey: string,
 *       venueName: string,
 *       venueCity: string | null,
 *       venueState: string | null,
 *       addedAt: serverTimestamp,
 *     }
 *
 * Matching: netlify/functions/venue-bucket-list-notifications.js is a daily
 * scheduled job (same precedent as anniversary-notifications.js) that, for
 * every user with at least one bucket-list venue, checks their favorite
 * artists' upcoming Ticketmaster events for a venue match and creates a
 * `venue_bucket_list_match` notification.
 *
 * Security rule lives in firestore.rules — deploy with `npm run
 * deploy:rules` after any change there.
