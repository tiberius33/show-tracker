/**
 * Pre-publication content filter — the "filtering objectionable material"
 * half of App Store Guideline 1.2.
 *
 * Two independent checks, run over every piece of free text a user can
 * publish (comments, captions, meetup bodies, display names, handles):
 *
 *   1. A slur/profanity match against BLOCKED_TERMS.
 *   2. A contact-harvesting spam check — emails, phone numbers and bare
 *      links to domains outside LINK_ALLOWLIST.
 *
 * WHY THE NORMALIZER IS THE INTERESTING PART. A wordlist matched against
 * raw text stops nobody: "f u c k", "fück", "fuuuuck" and "sh1t" all sail
 * past it. So both the input and the wordlist go through the same
 * normalize() before matching, which means the list is written in plain
 * spelling and every variant collapses onto it rather than needing its own
 * entry.
 *
 * WHY IT MATCHES WHOLE WORDS. Substring matching is how a filter starts
 * rejecting "Scunthorpe", "classic" and "Dickinson" — the canonical
 * embarrassment for this kind of code, and a worse user-facing failure
 * than the occasional miss. Every term is matched on token boundaries,
 * with a small suffix allowance so plurals and -ing forms still land.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a moderation system on its own — it is the
 * pre-publication gate. The report/block/admin-review loop in
 * lib/moderation.js is what catches everything a wordlist cannot, which
 * is most things.
 *
 * MIRRORED SERVER-SIDE. netlify/functions/lib/contentFilterRule.js is a
 * CommonJS copy of this file, following the arrangement
 * netlify/functions/lib/festivalMatchRule.js already uses, so a write that
 * skips the client cannot skip the filter.
 * lib/__tests__/contentFilterParity.test.js runs both over the same inputs
 * and asserts identical answers, so the two cannot drift silently.

// ── The wordlist ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One exported constant so it can be extended without touching a single
// call site. Written in plain spelling — normalize() handles the variants.
// Terms are matched as whole words (see WORD_SUFFIXES), which is why
// short entries like "ho" are safe to include here but would not be if
// this were a substring match.

  // Slurs. The reason this list exists at all; zero tolerance per the
  // Community Guidelines in components/TermsOfService.jsx.

  'chink', 'gook', 'wetback', 'raghead', 'towelhead', 'paki',

// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ON THE LIST, AND WHY. This is a concert app,

// comments here. "Cum On Feel the Noize" is a Slade song, "Ho Hey" is a
// Lumineers song, Dick Dale and David Lynch are artists people have seen
// live, and "fag" is a cigarette in half the English-speaking world. Every
// one of those was in the first draft of this list and every one of them
// would have rejected a legitimate post about a real show. Mild profanity
// ("piss", "damn") is left out for the same reason: Guideline 1.2 is about
// objectionable material, and a filter that fires on Ween song titles
// costs more trust than it earns. Anything this list misses is what the
// report and block loop is for.

// Suffixes a blocked term may carry and still count as the same word, so
// the list holds "fuck" rather than "fuck", "fucks", "fucked", "fucking".
// Deliberately short: a long list starts matching unrelated words that
// merely begin with a blocked term.
