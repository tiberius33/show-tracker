// lib/bandSetlist.js
//
// The client side of the band-source path: resolve an artist through the
// registry, and if a band source owns them, get that source's setlist for a
// date and hand back the show-document fields to write.
//
// This is the ONE place the app decides where a setlist comes from once a
// show has been identified, so the five add paths don't each grow their own
// copy of the logic. Everything funnels through AppContext's addShow /
// addShowsFromTour / scanForMissingSetlists, which is where this is called
// from — see the comment on buildShowDoc in context/AppContext.jsx ("Change
// the shape here or not at all").
//
// ── What this does NOT change ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// setlist.fm remains the show *discovery* layer everywhere it is one today:
// artist search, tour lists, venue and mbid resolution, the festival
// lineup lookup. Neither elgoose.net nor phish.net replaces those cleanly,
// and this change is not about replacing show search. It is only about
// where the setlist comes from once a show is identified.
//
// So the fall-through is silent and total: if the band source fails,
// returns nothing, or isn't configured, the caller keeps whatever
// setlist.fm gave it and records `setlistSource: 'setlistfm'`. A volunteer
// archive being down must never turn into a failed show add.

/**
 * fetchBandSetlistWithReason({ artist, artistMbid, date, venue })
 *   -> { result, reason, detail }
 *
 * The same fetch as fetchBandSetlist below, except it says WHY it came back
 * with nothing instead of collapsing every case onto null.
 *
 * The add paths don't care: there, a band source that has no show or is
 * having a bad day falls through to setlist.fm silently, and that is the
 * whole design. A re-fetch the user asked for by pressing a button is the
 * opposite case — "the archive has no show on this date", "one field in the
 * adapter is wrong" and "the request failed" are otherwise the same
 * nothing-happened, which is precisely what made the admin re-sync
 * impossible to diagnose from the outside.
 *
 * `reason` is one of:
 *   'ok'                     the result carries a setlist
 *   'missing-artist-or-date' nothing to ask with
 *   'not-a-band-source'      this artist's setlists belong to setlist.fm
 *   'http-error'             the function answered, but not with 200
 *   'no-show'                the archive has no show on that date
 *   'no-songs'               a show on that date, but no songs on it
 *   'bad-date'               the stored date could not be read at all
 *   'fetch-failed'           network error or timeout
 *
 * `detail` is the upstream's own message where there is one, so it can be
 * shown verbatim rather than paraphrased.
