// resuming on a deep link — there is no in-app history to go back to.
// `router.back()` there either does nothing or leaves the app entirely.
// So the parent is *derived from the route*, statically, and the back
// control always has somewhere to go.
//
// ROOT_ROUTES are floors: the gesture layer and the header both refuse to
// go back out of them. They are the five routes the (currently dormant,
// never-mounted) MobileTabBar names, plus `/`. Mounting that tab bar is an
// information-architecture decision and is deliberately not made here —
// this table only records which routes are logical roots.
