/**
 * Firestore helpers for in-app notifications — extends the existing
 * `notifications` collection (already used for the one-off
 * "your feedback was published to the roadmap" notice in AdminView.jsx;
 * see context/AppContext.jsx's `unreadNotifications` listener and
 * `markNotificationsRead()`, both pre-existing and reused as-is here) with
 * new types for concert engagement: someone replied to your comment,
 * liked your comment, or liked your photo/video.
 *
 * No Firestore rule change needed — the existing rule already allows any
 * authenticated user to create a notification for anyone (recipient-only
 * read/update), which is exactly "the app decides who deserves a
 * notification, not a per-doc ACL," same precedent as showComments/
 * showPhotos/userActivity.
 *
 * Schema (new fields alongside the pre-existing uid/type/message/read/
 * createdAt/itemId/itemTitle used by roadmap_published):
 *   notifications/{autoId}
 *     {
 *       uid: string,           // recipient
 *       type: 'comment_reply' | 'comment_like' | 'photo_like' | 'roadmap_published',
 *       message: string,       // prebuilt human-readable text
 *       concertKey: string | null,
 *       artist: string | null,
 *       venue: string | null,
 *       date: string | null,
 *       fromUid: string | null,
 *       fromName: string | null,
 *       read: boolean,
 *       createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
 *     }
 *
 * Linking back to a show: a notification doesn't carry a showId, because
 * concertKey isn't scoped to any one user's private show doc (the same
 * constraint documented in lib/activityFeed.js). Instead, the Notification
 * Center resolves a click by finding a show in the *recipient's own*
 * `shows` array whose normalizeShowKey() matches — which always exists,
 * since the recipient could only have gotten a notification here by
 * having logged a matching show (they had to have a comment/photo on it).
