/**
 * Firestore helpers for concert comments — discussion on a specific
 * concert (artist + venue + date), not tied to any one user's private
 * show record. A prior friend-to-friend "Shared Memories" comment feature
 * (visible only to you + one tagged friend) was built, then deliberately
 * removed in v4.1.1 — this is a different, broader shape: any signed-in
 * user who has logged a matching show can see and post in the thread, not
 * just a tagged pair.
 *
 * "Matching show" uses the same identity as AppContext's
 * normalizeShowKey() (setlist.fm ID when available, else a normalized
 * artist|venue|date string) — the same key that already powers Shows
 * Together and show-suggestion matching, so "is this the same concert"
 * means the same thing everywhere in the app.
 *
 * Schema: top-level `showComments` collection, one doc per comment
 * (top-level or reply — replies are one level deep only, via `parentId`).
 *
 *   showComments/{autoId}
 *     {
 *       concertKey: string,        // normalizeShowKey(show)
 *       parentId: string | null,   // set only on a reply
 *       authorUid: string,
 *       authorName: string,
 *       text: string,
 *       likedBy: string[],         // uids who liked this comment
 *       createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
 *     }
 *
 * Moderation: any authenticated user can delete their own comment;
 * ADMIN_EMAILS (lib/constants.js) can delete any comment. Firestore rules
 * can't import app code, so the admin email is duplicated in
 * firestore.rules — keep the two in sync if that list ever changes.
 *
 * WHY POSTING NO LONGER WRITES FIRESTORE DIRECTLY (v5.32.0). App Store
 * Guideline 1.2 requires objectionable material to be filtered before it
 * is published, and a filter that only runs in the browser is a
 * suggestion — the `showComments` create rule used to let any signed-in
 * user add a document, so anyone with the Firebase SDK could post
 * straight past it. Creation now goes through
 * netlify/functions/moderate-content.js, which runs the same filter
 * (lib/contentFilter.js, mirrored server-side) and is the only path the
 * rules still allow. Reads, likes and deletes are unchanged and still go
 * direct — none of them introduce new text.
