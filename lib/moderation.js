/**
 * Reporting and blocking — the other three quarters of App Store
 * Guideline 1.2 (the filter in lib/contentFilter.js is the first).
 *
 * Guideline 1.2 wants four things from an app with user-generated
 * content, and until now this app shipped exactly one of them (published
 * contact information, via the feedback page and the support address in
 * the Terms). This module is the data layer for the other three:
 *
 *   - report offensive content, with a route to action inside 24 hours
 *   - block abusive users
 *   - filter objectionable material before it is published
 *
 * ── WHERE THE DATA LIVES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `reports/{contentId}_{reporterId}`
 *   One report per user per item, enforced by the deterministic id rather
 *   than by a query — a second report from the same person overwrites
 *   their first instead of inflating the count that triggers auto-hide.
 *   Created by netlify/functions/report-content.js, never by the client:
 *   the count and the auto-hide have to be server-side or the threshold
 *   means nothing.
 *
 * `userBlocks/{uid}` -> { userId, blockedUserIds: [] }
 *   NOT on userProfiles, which is the app's user document but is readable
 *   by every signed-in user. A block list on a world-readable document
 *   tells the person you blocked that you blocked them, which is the one
 *   thing a block must never do. Same owner-only, uid-keyed shape as
 *   favoriteTours, including the docId pin that stops one user writing to
 *   another user's document.
 *
 *   (The Guideline 1.2 brief called for `users/{uid}.blockedUserIds`.
 *   `users/{uid}` has no root document in this app — user data hangs off
 *   subcollections and `userProfiles` — and putting the list on
 *   `userProfiles` would leak it, so it lives here instead. It is still a
 *   plain array loaded once into AppContext, which is what the rest of
 *   the brief depends on.)
 *
 * `userProfiles/{uid}.banned`
 *   A ban has to be readable by firestore.rules to be enforceable there,
 *   so unlike a block it does belong on the public profile document.
 *
 * `moderationHidden/{collection}_{docId}`
 *   Content pulled out of circulation pending review — see below.
 *
 * ── WHY AUTO-HIDE MOVES THE DOCUMENT INSTEAD OF FLAGGING IT ─────────────
 *
 * The obvious design is `hidden: true` on the content document. It does
 * not survive contact with Firestore, for two reasons that compound:
 *
 *   1. Rules are not filters. A query fails outright if ANY document it
 *      returns fails the read rule — so the moment one hidden comment
 *      exists on a show, an "only the author and admins may read hidden
 *      content" rule breaks the whole thread for everyone, rather than
 *      quietly omitting one row.
 *   2. Adding `where('hidden', '==', false)` to the queries fixes that
 *      only for documents that HAVE the field. Every comment, photo and
 *      caption already in production predates it, and both `== false` and
 *      `!= true` exclude documents where the field is absent — so
 *      shipping the filter would make every existing comment in the app
 *      vanish until a backfill caught up.
 *
 * So an auto-hidden document is copied into `moderationHidden` (admin-read
 * only) and deleted from its own collection. It drops out of every query
 * because it is genuinely no longer there, no backfill is needed, no query
 * changes, and "hidden content is not readable by third parties" is
 * enforced by the rule on one collection instead of by a condition on
 * five. Dismissing a report restores the document, with its original id,
 * from the copy.
 *
 * The trade against the flag design is that the author cannot see their
 * own content while it is under review. That is the same thing every
 * report-and-review system does, and the 24-hour commitment in the
 * Community Guidelines is what bounds it.
